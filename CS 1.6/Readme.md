# README
This is a custom configuration file (albeit a very simple one) for the game »Counter-Strike 1.6«.

## Features

* Fast weapon switching using the keyboard and mouse wheel.
* Small graphical enhancements to the game...
 
## How to install

1. Simply download the file `userconfig.cfg` to your computer. 
2. Next, locate the folder where the game's files are stored. On Windows the file path usually is

   ```
   C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\cstrike
   ```
   
   and on Linux
   
   ```
   ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/cstrike
   ```
   
3. There should be a file called `config.cfg` inside that folder. Open this file and make sure it contains the line
   ```
   exec userconfig.cfg
   ```
4. Copy the downloaded `userconfig.cfg` into the respective folder mentioned at step 2. If the file already exists
   you may want to manually merge the contents.

That's it. The changes should take effect the next time you start the game.
